            Thoughts is my favourites part! I want to develop a tool or script to let everyone be able to 
            upload their thoughts here, anytime, anywhere. Even though I know you can do it throught a lot of media platforms, I
            still think people need a more private or I would say personal place to deal with these good or bad feelings. 
            And I think it's cool to customize your own style.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my personal website so I would like to share my life,hobbies and even phylosophy. I used to have a 
            <a href="https://leo0410-personal-website.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">fancy one</a> 
            based on React from
            vercel template but now I prefer simple. What inspire and impress me is that most genius people and those professors' website is usually simple and down to earth 
            like my professor:
            <a href="https://haipeng-luo.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">haipeng-luo</a>
    
            .How do you think if you just simply put "Founder and CEO of Google" on your website? </p>
          <p>
            Later I may develop token to let people get access to private content.The thoughts is usually updates weekly.
